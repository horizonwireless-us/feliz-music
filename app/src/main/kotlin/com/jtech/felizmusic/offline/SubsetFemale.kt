/**
 * Female-involvement detection — the offline port of `zemer-search/index/credits.mjs` plus the
 * author-name half of `zemer-search/index/female-owned.mjs`. Deterministic, pure string ops.
 *
 * Two jobs, both reusing the same cross-script matcher built from the whitelist's female artists:
 *  - [isFemaleInvolved] — a male-primary track still counts as female-involved when the credit is in
 *    the TITLE (e.g. `"Shiru (feat. Franciska)"`) or in a secondary artist credit. Every credited name
 *    is validated against the female whitelist, so an unknown name can never over-filter (only a
 *    positively-known female triggers a drop).
 *  - [isCommunityFemaleOwned] — a community playlist is female-owned when its curator name matches a
 *    known female artist.
 *
 * Matching reuses [SubsetNormalize] (the same normalizer the rest of offline search uses): exact
 * whole-token normalized names for same-script, plus a consonant skeleton tagged with the entry's
 * SCRIPT for CROSS-SCRIPT alignment only (a Hebrew whitelist name vs a romanized credit, or vice
 * versa — same-script skeletons collide badly, so same-script must hit the exact name). Skeletons
 * gate at >=3 chars (a 2-char skeleton collides).
