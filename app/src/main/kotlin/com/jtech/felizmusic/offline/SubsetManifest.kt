/**
 * The on-device outage-fallback snapshot ("subset") lets the app search and browse the whole Zemer
 * corpus (everything except audio playback) with no InnerTube/YouTube when `search.horizonwireless.us` is
 * unreachable, and serve those reads locally even while online when the local copy is in sync.
 *
 * The `GET /subset/manifest` document is the authoritative set of content-addressed shards making up
 * the current snapshot. Syncing is incremental and driven purely by this manifest: a shard whose
 * [SubsetShard.hash] differs from the local copy is re-downloaded **wholesale** (never merged), and a
 * shard absent from a newer manifest is **deleted** locally — so both content additions and removals
 * propagate without any server-side changelog. See [subsetSyncPlan].

 * mis-decode silently — a breaking format change must bump the server's `schema` field, and a client
 * seeing an unknown generation rejects the manifest wholesale and keeps its last-good snapshot.
 * A manifest without the field (today's server) is generation 1.
