/**
 * Push ONE deferred offline listen as a late playback-stats session — fresh `/player` for the real
 * tracking URLs (their `ei`/`plid`/`vm` tokens are fresh, so there is no expiry problem, which is why
 * deferral works), one fresh `cpn`, then the playback ping (`cmt=0`, `final=0`) and a single `final=1`
 * watchtime ping carrying the STORED real ranges — nothing re-derived, nothing fabricated.
 *
 * Network I/O is injected ([fetchTracking]/[sendPlayback]/[sendWatchtime], each returning the HTTP
 * status or null on throw) so the keep-vs-drop classification is unit-testable without YouTube.
 *
 * The watchtime ping is fired ONLY after the playback (session-open) ping is accepted — a watchtime
 * with no preceding playback ping is the orphan shape a real client never produces, AND on a partial
 * failure (playback ok, watchtime not) the whole record is re-pushed under a fresh cpn next time, so
 * beaconing the watchtime before the playback succeeds would double-count on retry. Classification:
 *  - playback not 2xx → 400 ⇒ DROP (malformed), else ⇒ RETRY (watchtime NOT sent)
 *  - playback 2xx, then watchtime: 2xx ⇒ SUCCESS, 400 ⇒ DROP, else ⇒ RETRY
