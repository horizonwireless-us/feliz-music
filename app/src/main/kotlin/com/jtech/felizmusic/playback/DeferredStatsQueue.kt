/**
 * The durable queue + reconnect flusher for offline/cached listens whose LIVE YouTube playback-stats
 * session could not fire (no network → no `/player` tracking URLs). Additive to [WatchTimeReporter];
 * the live DIRECT path is untouched — this only recovers the plays it deliberately drops, by pushing
 * a *deferred* stats session from a fresh `/player` once the device is back online.
 *
 * Fire-and-forget by contract (mirrors the telemetry `Tracker`): every entry point is a cheap
 * `scope.launch` onto a caller-provided single dispatcher, so all queue access is single-threaded and
 * nothing here can block playback. Durability reuses [TrackingQueue] (JSONL under `filesDir`, cap
 * [MAX_SIZE], drop-oldest, atomic rewrite — no Room, no migration); backoff reuses [FlushSchedule].
 *
 * The network push is injected ([push]) so the queue/scheduling/staleness logic is unit-testable
 * without YouTube; [MusicService] wires the real push ([pushDeferredStats]).
