/**
 * One offline/cached listen whose live YouTube playback-stats session could NOT fire (no network →
 * no `/player` tracking URLs), captured to push later when the device reconnects. Additive to the
 * live watch-time session ([WatchTimeReporter]): the live path is untouched; this only recovers the
 * plays it deliberately drops.
 *
 * The stored ranges are the SAME real ranges [WatchTimeSegments] computed for the listen — nothing is
 * fabricated. On flush they ride a fresh WEB_REMIX `/player` session verbatim: `st`/`et` the watched
 * ranges, `cmt` the final media position, `rt` the total real watched seconds. All fields are already
 * beacon-shaped (seconds strings) so the flusher does no re-derivation.
