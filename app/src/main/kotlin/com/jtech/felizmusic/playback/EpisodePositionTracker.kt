/**
 * Owns podcast-EPISODE resume: persisting where the user left off and seeking back there on the next
 * open. Extracted from [MusicService] (the giant-shrinking rule) so the whole resume policy lives in one
 * place instead of being spread across `onIsPlayingChanged` / `onMediaItemTransition` / `onDestroy`.
 * Songs are never touched, so music behaviour is unchanged; the cast receiver owns its own position, so
 * everything here no-ops while casting (`isCasting`). All pure resume-edge decisions live in the
 * unit-tested [EpisodeResume].
 *
 * Everything runs on [scope] (the service Main scope), so the tracking fields are single-thread-confined
 * and the player is only ever read on the main thread (never inside `database.query {}` — that posts to a
 * background executor and would trip "Player accessed on the wrong thread").
