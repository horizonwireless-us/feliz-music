/**
 * Guards the tracking/history signal across audio↔video rendition swaps (I4). A swap ends the current
 * ExoPlayer `PlaybackStats` session mid-listen, so `onPlaybackStatsReady` fires — without this guard a
 * single toggle would double-fire the `play` tracking event, double-insert the history `Event`, and
 * double-register YouTube playback for one listen.
 *
 * The rule: a stats-ready that was caused by a swap is **suppressed**, its play time **stashed**; the
 * next non-swap (real) end **emits once** with the accumulated total. Pure + JVM-tested; the controller
 * calls [onSwap] immediately before it issues a swap, and [MusicService] routes every stats-ready
 * through [onStatsReady]. State is memory-only (process death mid-video loses the stash — acceptable,
 * telemetry is fire-and-forget).
