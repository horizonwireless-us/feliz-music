/**
 * One client playback nonce (`cpn`) per in-flight listen, shared between the media (googlevideo)
 * request and the watch-time beacon session — exactly what the official WEB_REMIX client does
 * (base.js `cpn=${videoData.clientPlaybackNonce}` on the media URL, the same cpn on its stats
 * beacons). Correlating the two lets YouTube tie the reported watch time to real byte delivery.
 *
 * Keyed by BASE videoId (see [VideoRendition.baseVideoId]) so a listen's audio, video-mode and
 * merge-audio renditions all resolve to ONE cpn. [getOrCreate] is called from BOTH the stream
 * resolver (a background thread) and the [WatchTimeReporter] session (the service main scope), so
 * every access is `synchronized`. The reporter [release]s the id when its listen ends, so the next
 * play of the same song mints a fresh cpn (matching the client's fresh-cpn-per-playback model, which
 * keeps view counts incrementing).
 *
 * Bounded WITHOUT ever wiping the live listen's cpn: an excluded/skipped resolve (cast, relay,
 * preload that never plays) can leave a stray, so the store is an access-ordered LRU that evicts the
 * LEAST-recently-used entry past [MAX_ENTRIES]. The active listen is [pin]ned by the reporter and is
 * never evicted while it plays — the earlier wholesale `clear()` could drop the currently-playing
 * cpn mid-stream, silently breaking the very byte↔beacon correlation this class exists for.
