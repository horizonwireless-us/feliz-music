/**
 * Owns the audio↔video **rendition swap** for the current queue item — the service-scoped state machine
 * behind the in-player Song/Video toggle (the [CastController] pattern). The queue item never changes
 * (same mediaId, same MediaMetadata tag, same index — I4); a "video mode" only replaces the current
 * MediaItem's URI/cacheKey with a `video:<id>` rendition ([VideoRendition]) that the resolver serves as a
 * progressive muxed stream, seeks to the captured position, and reverts on ANY track transition, cast
 * connect, block toggle, error, or restart (I2/I5).
 *
 * All pure decisions live in [VideoModeLogic]/[ListenAccumulator] (JVM-tested); this class does the
 * player mutations, which need a device and are covered by the step-3 on-device checklist. Everything
 * runs on [scope] (the service Main scope), so the swap-tracking fields are single-thread-confined.
 *
 * NOTE (step-3 empirical shrink, 2026-07-08): the authenticated `next()` counterpart probe found NO
 * `playlistPanelVideoWrapperRenderer`s (see the step-3 PROGRESS report), so the COUNTERPART rendition —
 * an audio song → its separate music video — does not light up for the tested account. The plumbing is
 * kept (it costs nothing and turns on automatically if a pooled/Premium account ever returns wrappers,
 * fed passively via [recordCounterparts]); the shipping renditions are SELF (a video item shows its own
 * video) and LOCAL (a downloaded muxed video file). Pooled-account counterpart availability is flagged
 * for the step-6 on-device pass.
