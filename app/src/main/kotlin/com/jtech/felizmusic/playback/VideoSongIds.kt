/**
 * Process-wide registry of ids the CORPUS classified as video-songs ([com.metrolist.innertube.models.SongItem.isVideo],
 * set once by ZemerResultMapper). Marked at the SongItem → MediaMetadata boundary — the flag is
 * deliberately NOT persisted into playback metadata (downloads/library must treat video-songs as
 * ordinary audio), but the Song/Video toggle needs it: the corpus classification is authoritative,
 * so the toggle can show INSTANTLY instead of waiting a network round-trip for YouTube's own
 * musicVideoType (which, once learned, still governs — see VideoModeLogic.availability).
 *
 * Bounded LRU so a long session can't grow it unbounded; thread-safe (marked from UI threads,
 * read from the controller's main scope).
