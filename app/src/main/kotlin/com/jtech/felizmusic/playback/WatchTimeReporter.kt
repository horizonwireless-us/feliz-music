/**
 * Emulates a genuine YouTube Music playback-stats session for every DIRECT play — music, video-songs
 * and podcast episodes alike.
 *
 * One session per listen, keyed by one cpn: a playback ping when the listen actually starts
 * (`cmt=<start position>`, `final=0`), watchtime pings at the server's scheduled cadence (see
 * [WatchTimeSchedule]) plus on pause/seek, and a `final=1` watchtime ping when the listen ends. Every
 * reported range comes from
 * [WatchTimeSegments] fed with real player positions — nothing is ever fabricated (the spec's hard
 * rule: fabricated watch time is invalid traffic).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT running: RELAY mode (the spec's other hard rule — beacons must never ride the
 * relay egress) and cast sessions (the receiver plays, not this device). A video-mode rendition swap
 * and its repeat-one loop never reach [onTransition] (MusicService's own-swap early return), so the
 * session correctly spans the whole listen across audio/video swaps.
 *
 * Extracted from [MusicService] (the giant-shrinking rule), mirroring [EpisodePositionTracker]:
 * session state is confined to [scope] (the service main scope); only the tracking-URL cache is
 * concurrent (seeded from the data-source resolver thread). Beacons are fire-and-forget: a network
 * failure logs and moves on — stats must never affect playback.
