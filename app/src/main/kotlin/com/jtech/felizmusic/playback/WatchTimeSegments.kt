/**
 * Accumulates the media-time ranges ACTUALLY played during one playback session, and drains them as
 * the `st`/`et` parameter lists of a watchtime ping.
 *
 * Pure and single-caller-thread-confined (the service main scope) — no player, no clock. The owner
 * feeds it real position observations:
 *  - [onPlay] when playback (re)starts at a position — opens a segment;
 *  - [onProgress] with the current position while playing — extends the open segment;
 *  - [onPause] when playback stops — closes the open segment;
 *  - [onSeek] on a position discontinuity — closes at the departed position, reopens at the target;
 *  - [drain] to emit everything watched since the previous drain (the delta model the official web
 *    client uses: each ping carries only the newly watched ranges, never a cumulative resend).
 *
 * The hard rule is honesty: a range is reported iff the player actually traversed it. Seeking is
 * never watched time; a paused player accumulates nothing.
