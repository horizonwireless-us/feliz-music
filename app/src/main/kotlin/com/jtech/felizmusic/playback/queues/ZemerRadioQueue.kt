/**
 * Corpus-native radio (Zemer `/radio`): an endless, whitelist-pure continuation queue seeded by an
 * artist / album / song, or `kind=shuffle` (no seed) for the Home "Radio mode". It replaces
 * `YouTube.next()` for SELECTION only — the audio stream still comes from InnerTube + the cipher.
 *
 * The server's `continuation` is an opaque token (it encodes the seed + flags + position), so this queue
 * keeps no cursor state: [getInitialStatus] pulls the first page and stashes the token, [nextPage] echoes
 * it back for the next slice. Radio items are autoplay fill, so they report as "radio" (tracking §3.3).
 *
 * Built from just a [Context] (repository resolved via [ZemerSearchRepositoryEntryPoint]) so it works from
 * ViewModels and leaf menu composables alike.
