/**
 * The relay-only device id (header [HEADER]) that lets `stream.horizonwireless.us` count distinct relay devices per
 * content-filter (the relay pairs the id with the request's filter-egress IP).
 *
 * SEPARATE from the zemer-stats tracking id ([RelayDeviceIdKey] vs `TrackingDeviceIdKey`) and only ever sent
 * to the relay, so the pairing stays relay-only and never joins the PII-free listening history. Sent on
 * RELAY-mode requests only, never DIRECT. Debug builds send NO id ([resolve] returns null under
 * `BuildConfig.DEBUG`) and mark requests with `x-zemer-debug` instead so they serve but are not counted.
 * Contract: `handoff-docs/zemer-app-relay-device-id-request.md` (option B).
