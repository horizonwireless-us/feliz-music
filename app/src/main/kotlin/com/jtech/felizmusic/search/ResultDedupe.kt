/**
 * The unified-video "one result per certainly-matched song" rule (I3 / unified-video DESIGN §7).
 *
 * When a rendered screen shows both audio song rows and video rows, a video row is dropped **only** when
 * an audio song row in the SAME screen is an AUTHORITATIVE match for it:
 *   1. identical videoId, or
 *   2. a known song→video counterpart mapping ([counterpartOf]) links them.
 *
 * There is deliberately **no** title / artist / duration heuristic: an unconfirmed audio/video pair stays
 * as two rows (the official audio release, and the video release playing its extracted audio). The
 * governing guarantee is that **no video ever becomes unreachable through dedupe** — a dropped video is
 * always still reachable via the surviving song row's in-player video toggle (rule 1 → same id is the
 * same item; rule 2 → the COUNTERPART toggle).
 *
 * The counterpart tier is dormant in the shipped app (step 3 found `next()` returns no counterparts for
 * the personal/anonymous accounts, so [counterpartOf] defaults to a no-op); rule 1 (same videoId) is the
 * only tier that currently fires. If counterpart data ever lights up, pass a real [counterpartOf].
 *
 * Callers must gate on `!blockVideos`: blocked mode is frozen byte-for-byte (spec §1(a)), so no dedupe
 * runs there.
