 * Wire models for `GET /genres` (search.horizonwireless.us) — the song-level genre layer (contract:
 * `~/zemer-fix/handoff-docs/zemer-app-genres.md`). Two hard rules from that contract:
 *
 * - **Key off the slug ([ZemerGenreSummary.id]), never the label** — `title` is a display string the
 *   server changes freely.
 * - **Absent `genres` on a track = UNKNOWN, never "none"** — ~84% of songs are unclassified, so the
 *   app never derives "not in genre X" from a missing tag. (The per-track `genres` field is not even
 *   modeled here; the lenient reader ignores it.)
 *
 * Counts are post-filter: the server computes them against the content flags sent, so every count is
 * reachable by that viewer. All fields are defaulted for the same reason as [ZemerSearchModels]:
 * kotlinx throws MissingFieldException for the WHOLE response if one element omits a required field.
