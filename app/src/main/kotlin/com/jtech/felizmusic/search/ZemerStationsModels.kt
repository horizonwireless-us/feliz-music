/**
 * Wire models for **Zemer Stations** — synchronized broadcast radio (`GET /stations`,
 * `GET /station?id=`), per the handoff doc `~/zemer-fix/handoff-docs/zemer-app-stations.md`. One
 * shared, server-programmed wall-clock schedule per station: every listener hears the SAME track at
 * the SAME moment; the client's only job is to join at the live offset and keep step (see
 * [stationJoinPositionMs]). Field names match the JSON exactly; everything the server may omit is
 * nullable/defaulted so a sparse row never fails deserialization (the shared lenient reader).
 *
 * Content policy (handoff §6): the pools are pre-filtered server-side to the strictest common
 * denominator, so the content flags are NOT sent to these endpoints, and the row is hidden in
 * kidZone mode. Responses are clock-dependent — never cache them. Stations are LIVE-ONLY: never
 * served from the offline snapshot (like `/playlist` and `/radio`).
