/**
 * Pure decision logic for the bidirectional YouTube-Music podcast sync (subscriptions +
 * episodes-for-later). Extracted from [com.jtech.felizmusic.utils.SyncUtils] so the reconcile rules are
 * JVM-unit-testable without a database or a live InnerTube call - the sync bodies themselves need
 * both, but every branch they take is decided here.
 *
 * Server-first, exactly like the music library sync: YouTube Music is the source of truth, but a
 * podcast/episode the user removed LOCALLY (present in the DB but no longer bookmarked / saved) is
 * never silently re-added, because the matching remote removal is likely still in flight.
