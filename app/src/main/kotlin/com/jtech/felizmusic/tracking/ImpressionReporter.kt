/**
 * Reports what the app SHOWED, for the ranking side's exposure dampener.
 *
 * The normative definition of an impression (agreed with the tracking maintainer, mirrored in
 * `docs/tracking/README.md`) is deliberately STRICTER than "rendered": an item counts only once it
 * is inside the viewport AND has stayed there for [DWELL_MS]. Compose composes ahead of the
 * viewport, so counting composition would credit songs with attention they never got — and since
 * the dampener DOCKS a song for being widely shown, over-counting exposure silently penalises
 * songs, while under-counting is merely conservative. When in doubt, do not report.
 *
 * Reporting is keyed off the list's own item KEYS rather than visible indices. Indices identify
 * nothing in a heterogeneous list — headers, chips and section titles share the index space with
 * results — and an index-based variant would additionally require the caller to pass a list
 * identical to the one it renders, an invariant nothing can enforce and which fails silently by
 * reporting the wrong videoIds under the right surface. [idOfKey] maps a key to a videoId and
 * returns null for everything that isn't a song.
 *
 * Dedup, chunking, videoId filtering and the drop-under-backoff policy all live in
 * [Tracker.impression]; this layer only decides what is on screen.
