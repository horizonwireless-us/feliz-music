/**
 * Anonymous usage telemetry (the tracking spec: `docs/tracking/README.md`). The whole feature is
 * fire-and-forget by contract: nothing here may block UI, delay playback, or surface an error —
 * every entry point is a cheap `scope.launch` onto a single-threaded dispatcher, and every failure
 * is silent (a dropped event is fine; broken playback is not).
 *
 * Identity is one random UUID minted on first use and stored in DataStore — never any account,
 * device, or location identifier. The server 400s non-canonical device ids, so only
 * [UUID.randomUUID] output is ever sent.
 *
 * Flush triggers (spec §2): queue ≥ [FLUSH_THRESHOLD], 60 s with a non-empty queue, or the app
 * going to background. One in-flight upload at a time, and EVERY trigger honors the failure
 * backoff ([FlushSchedule]): while the server fails/rate-limits, threshold and background triggers
 * wait out the 30 s → 2 min → 10 min ladder instead of re-hammering. A 400 drops the batch; the
 * queue caps at 500 dropping oldest ([TrackingQueue]).
