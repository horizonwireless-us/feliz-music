/**
 * The position column of an `auto-*` chart row: the rank, then to its right a small triangle with
 * how far the song moved, `NEW`/`RE` for a debut or return, and nothing at all when it held its
 * position.
 *
 * The marker is drawn only on rows that actually moved — an unchanged row stays empty, so the
 * noise floor a dash-per-row would create never appears while the magnitude is still there on the
 * rows where it means something.
 *
 * Two things this must get right:
 *
 * - **[movement] == null draws no marker** — not a dash, not a zero, and never a diff against a
 *   device-local snapshot. Absent movement is normal: a curated non-chart playlist, a too-young rank
 *   history, or a per-chart formula change that reset that chart's baseline (which also blanks
 *   briefly, until the next successful run, when a generator tick is skipped). The rank still shows.
 * - **The glyph never carries the meaning alone.** ▲ and ▼ differ mainly by colour in most palettes,
 *   so the whole cell exposes ONE spoken label and hides its parts from the accessibility tree.
 *
 * The rank sits right-aligned in a fixed sub-width and the whole cell is a fixed width, so both the
 * numbers and the titles beside them line up down the list whether or not a row has a marker.
