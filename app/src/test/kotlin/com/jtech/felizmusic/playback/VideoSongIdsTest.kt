/**
 * Regression tests for the Song/Video toggle disappearing mid-session (#385): the registry is an
 * access-ordered LRU, and only get/put refresh recency — so [VideoSongIds.contains] must read via
 * `get`, or the CURRENTLY PLAYING id (read every availability recompute, never re-marked) ages out
 * after 512 later marks and the toggle silently vanishes for the song on screen.
 *
 * VideoSongIds is a process-wide singleton, so every test uses fresh unique ids (no reset API —
 * deliberately, production has no reset either).
