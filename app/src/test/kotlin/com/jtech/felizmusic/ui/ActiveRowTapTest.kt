/**
 * The active-row tap rule (issue #324): tapping the currently-playing song in a list toggles
 * play/pause EXCEPT during a station broadcast, where it must fall through to a fresh play from 0
 * - the broadcast masks seek/skip, so the row tap is the only way to replay a song heard
 * mid-broadcast (e.g. like it on the radio, open Liked songs, tap it).
