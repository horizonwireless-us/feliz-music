/**
 * Regression tests for the podcast library gate:
 *  - the channel-vs-show keying bug: the podcast whitelist is keyed by the host CHANNEL id (`UC…`), but
 *    subscribed rows were being filtered by the SHOW id (`MPSP…`) against it, which never matches — so
 *    once the whitelist populated, the subscribed list and New Episodes went permanently empty.
 *  - the female gate: display surfaces must hide a wholly-female host channel when female filtering is on
 *    (they were using membership-only `isChannelWhitelisted`, leaking a female channel into the library).
 * [PodcastLibrarySources.subscribedPodcastAllowed]/[podcastChannelAllowed] key off the channel id AND
 * apply the female gate.
